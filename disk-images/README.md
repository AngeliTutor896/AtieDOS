# How to emulate it
This depends on the emulator you are using, but if you are using QEMU, use
qemu-system-x86_64 or qemu-system-x86_64.exe for Windows.

# How to use it in real hardware
The .iso is just a binary file. This means that you can rename it to anything or burn it to anything and
it will work. If you are using Windows and you want to burn this to an USB, use Rufus.
**Important: Your PC needs to have BIOS or UEFI with BIOS support if you want to use this OS on real hardware.**
